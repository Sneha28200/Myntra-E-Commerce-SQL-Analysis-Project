# Myntra-E-Commerce-SQL-Analysis-Project
In this project, I solved business-driven questions using SQL on Myntra dataset.
1. Business Questions

2. SQL Queries with Sample Outputs

3. Insights :
      Premium categories like footwear and luxury apparel dominate the list.
      Ethnic wear and jackets often appear at the top — useful for premium pricing strategy.
      Top brands are high-frequency sellers and contribute heavily to Myntra’s product catalog. Helps in inventory prioritization.
      Seasonal apparel categories tend to offer higher discounts. This helps in demand generation during off-seasons.
      Highly rated products create opportunities for cross-promotion and brand trust.
      Some mid-range brands outperform luxury ones in value-for-money. This shows opportunities for affordable branding strategies.
      Budget products dominate the catalog, but premium products drive higher per-unit profits.
      Moderate discounts (20–50%) drive the highest engagement, while extreme discounts do not always correlate with reviews.

   Through SQL, I identified pricing strategies, discount effectiveness, and brand performance. These insights can help optimize revenue and customer engagement.
